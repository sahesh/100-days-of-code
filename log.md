# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 02, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code challenge. As the first day I started to learn bootstrap. Learned Typography, Grid System and Containers.

**Thoughts:** I have used bootstrap before , but started to learn from the basics today. Had some good idea about basic stuffs. Hope to increase the coding time.
